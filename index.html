        <h1>How to use GitHub to Create Live Websites</h1>
        <img src="assets/step_1.png" alt="step 1">
        <h2>Step 1 - Create Repository</h2>
        <p>Login to your github account and click the plus button at the top right. Then click "New repository."</p>
        <img src="assets/step_2.png" alt="step 2">
        <h2>Step 2 - Name Repository</h2>
        <p>Name the repository next to where the owner is specified. Optionally, select "Initilize this repository with a README" then click "Create repository."</p>
        <img src="assets/step_3.png" alt="step 3">
        <h2>Step 3 - Upload Files</h2>
        <p>Once you are redirected (after the repository is done being created) drag and drop files onto the page to begin uploading. Alternatively, you can manually search for files to upload. <br/>Once those have uploaded, optionally enter a description of the commit and press the "Commit changes" button.</p>
        <img src="assets/step_4.png" alt="step 4">
        <h2>Step 4 - Navigate to Settings</h2>
        <p>Wait for the file processing screen to disappear. Now that the files are committed, navigate to the settings page using the toolbar.</p>
        <img src="assets/step_5.png" alt="step 5">
        <h2>Step 5 - Select Master Branch</h2>
        <p>Once on the settings page, navigate down to the GitHub Pages section. Click "None" and select "master branch" to tell GitHub what folder to host from.</p>
        <img src="assets/step_6.png" alt="step 6">
        <h2>Step 6 - Wait</h2>
        <p>Now you wait. You can see the link to your site, but GitHub is currently in the process of publishing it. Hang on.</p>
        <img src="assets/step_7.png" alt="step 7">
        <h2>Step 7 - Click It!</h2>
        <p>Once your site has been published, you will see the section with your link has changed to a green background. Click that link like there's no tomorrow. The end.</p>
